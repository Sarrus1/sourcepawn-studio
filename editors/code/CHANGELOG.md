## [2.2.0]

### Added

- Added a file system watcher to react to deletion/addition of .inc or .sp files.
- Added support for [code outline](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_breadcrumbs). This works for functions, enum structs, enums and methodmaps.

### Fixed

- Fixed parsing of natives declared on multiple lines.
- Fixed variable parsing when there is a trailing comment.
- Fixed methodmap's method parsing error.

### Removed

- Removed the initial parsing of all .sp files present in the workspace. This should lower the loading time (or even the crash in some cases) of the extension for users who have all their projects in a single workspace.

## [2.1.3]

### Fixed

- Remove images from package.

## [2.1.2]

### Added

- Add proper highlighting inside enums.

### Fixed

- Fixed defines and enum members being highlighted in strings and block comments.

## [2.1.1]

### Fixed

- Fixed logic error in enum struct parsing.

## [2.1.0]

### Added

- Added `this` support inside enum structs.
- Added GoToDefinition support inside enum structs' methods.

### Fixed

- Fixed parsing error for `<keyword>[] <variablename>` variable declarations.
- Fixed parsing of enum struct methods, where the last one would be considered like a global function.

## [2.0.2]

### Fixed

- Improved functions parsing.
- Fixed `//` in doc comments.
- Fixed defines and enum members being highlighted in comments.

## [2.0.1]

### Added

- Added proper highlighting support for `undef`, `function`, `typedef` and `typeset`.
- Added highlighting support for `FormatTime` placeholders.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where global methodmap variables wouldn't get method/property autocompletion.
- Method/Property completions won't suggest the constructor if the `new` keyword isn't detected.
- Fixed incorrect parsing for function descriptions containing \< and \>.
- Improved support for Intellisense for projects containing multiple .sp files. If MainPath is properly configured, Intellisens will work correctly.

## [2.0.0]

### Added

- Completion now only suggest methods and properties that belong to the methodmap or the enum struct of the variable.
- MethodMap completions now suggest inherited properties and methods.
- MethodMap and enum structs' completions are now suggested even for arrays elements and function calls.
- Added support for autocompletion for nested enum structs' properties and methods.
- Added support for the `new` keyword. Suggestions will only suggest constructors and the extension will provide signatures accordingly.
- Function and method signatures now work even if there is no JSDoc comment right above.
- Added an option to specify a path relative to the workspace when creating a new project.
- Implemented scopped completions for variables. A variable won't be suggested if the user is typing outside of the variable's scope.

- Complete refactoring of the GoToDefinition system, which now updates the location of an item every parsing.
- Added support for signatures help in multi-line function calls.
- Added escaped characters highlighting.
- Added dynamic syntax highlighting for defines and enum Members.

### Fixed

- Improved overall performances by over 50% in some cases (completions were sometimes iterated over twice, which caused delays in large files).
- Made `#include`, `#pragma`, etc statements highlighting closer to C/C++ highlighting.
- Fixed an issue for include files not inside an `include` folder.
- Fixed an error where function signatures would get confused if a `,` was in a string or an array.
- Fixed unprompted autocompletion when typing misc characters like `\` or `"`.
- Fixed an issue where signatures helpers wouldn't work properly on secondary .sp files.
- Improved syntax highlighting for function return types.
- GoToDefinition, Hover, and Signatures are now less random.
